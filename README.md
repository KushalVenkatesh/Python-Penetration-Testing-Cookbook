# Python Penetration Testing Cookbook
This is the code repository for [Python Penetration Testing Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/python-penetration-testing-cookbook), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Penetration testing is the use of tools and code to attack a system in order to assess its vulnerabilities to external threats. Python allows pen testers to create their own tools. Since Python is a highly valued pen-testing language, there are many native libraries and Python bindings available specifically for pen-testing tasks.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
import urllib.request
import urllib.parse
import re
from os.path import basename
```

Basically, a computer with Python installed on it. Simulating vulnerable machines and
testing can be done using virtual machines.
